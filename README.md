# react-sass-noeject-template

React app template with sass configured without ejecting  
  
Steps to run:  
`git clone ...`  
`npm install`  
`npm start`
  
That's it and now you have basic react app setup with sass. After running `npm start` navigate to `localhost:8080` or whichever port you are using. You will see a page with 'test' in green to show sass is working.  
  
Navigate to `src/styles/scss` folder to input sass code and notice it gets converted to regular css when you save it in the `src/styles/css/App.css`
